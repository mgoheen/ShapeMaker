# ShapeMaker
ShapeMaker is a good example of using object-oriented design to achieve a clean and efficient program. In this program, the user is able to draw a variety of different shapes on the screen using the mouse. These shapes include circles, squares, lines, ovals, and rectangles. The user is able to select any color they wish to use for any shape and whether or not they want it filled in with color. In addition, it is possible to undo previous actions and clear the canvas area of all drawn shapes. The control panel for the various actions are represented on the top with simple and intuitive graphical elements like buttons and drop-down menus. The canvas or drawing area is below this control panel.
